They have one of the rarest abilities that descended from the Astralites; 'Genesis', the power of creation. They can create things using their imagination, though every detail must be thought of in every way to avoid fail. ",
								"Archivers are tasked to record every living being that exists to record their existence, and prevent them from going extinct. There are three jobs given to Archivers as hand-in-hand partners, the \"Illustrators\" are given the task to illustrate an image of each living being, and \"Recorders\" are tasked to explain each and every detail about these living beings; what they do, what they look like, their diet, etc. And lastly, the \"Summoner\", who's responsible for taking the details relayed by the other two. These Archivers hold hands as they concentrate transferring each detailed information to create anything and everything. The Order created these three jobs in order to discourage handling three at the same time by one person and letting them create whatever they want. This is their form of discipline and maintenance of order. Each job is taught differently from the other. The Illustrators are taught how to draw, the Recorders are taught how to read and write, and the Summoners are trained how to use their imagination.",
								"The Archivers are instructed by a higher administrative Order. This Order is a group of elderly Astralites who officiate and instruct the Archivers. A new rule was passed however, a rule that will change archiving archiving forever. It has been decided that living beings that don't contribute any valuable resource and living beings that create hostile environments are no longer allowed to be archived. Upon its announcement, this rule was effective immediately.",
								"Shocked and appalled, every Archiver voiced their opinions about this change and have collectedly appealed this decision, but the decision was final. The Archivers have no choice but follow the Order's instructions or be exiled. In light of the recent changes, every book has been inspected, and every page that archived a living being deemed as \"hostile\" or \"useless\", has been ripped and torn. Confused and defiant, one fateful Summoner rebelled against this new established rule, seeing it as unreasonable and went against the absolute rule of archiving \"Nothing Is Left Behind\". As soon as new archiving expeditions arrive, he began to master how to read and write and created his own language, complete with different and unique letters. He would practice drawing in secret when arriving in different planets. All of this, done behind everyone's back.",
								"The Arbiter of Time noticed his rebellion, reminding him of his age of rebellion. Convinced, he made contact with him and offered him a favor. The Arbiter of Time himself, allowed this rebellious Summoner to travel back in time to archive every living being that has its archive ripped from the books, and beings before the archivers even existed. He allowed him to travel to planets, solar systems, and galaxies that have been long gone. This is the very book he authored, named the \"Mawhali Record\". A record of all living beings from the past and present who have mostly gone extinct.",
								"After he's being satisfied of what he did, he arrived on Earth. He petrified the book and displayed it on a pedestal, as a monument of his achievement. He considered it as a time capsule of sorts. He knows that if he brought it home, he would be exiled as his book defied the new rule.",
								"Despite his best efforts, the Order grew suspicious of his behavior. During the inspection of the recent planetary expedition, there were \"notes\" that detailed his \"brilliant\" and \"detailed\" knowledge of the living beings. The Order decided to test him under the guise of a congratulatory celebration. He was tested using claims of his feats that only Illustrators and Recorders are experienced in. ",
								"He began to agree to everything they said, proving the Order's suspicion to be correct. The Order immediately stripped him of his status as an Archiver in front of everyone he knew. He felt betrayed, knowing that everyone he knew and loved contributed to his downfall. By the Order's decree, he is to be exiled from his home dimension, along with the erasure of his memories. Chained and in sorrow, he whispered \"You'll see me again, when your lives flash before your eyes\" in his own language (Atikikam oynoka, tilu ogaboyak yatamam).",

All you need to do is craft an ore seed and plant it on terrain that doesn't necessarily need to be stone or deepslate and the ore seed will transform the area full of bountiful resources. Be warned however, there is a really small chance that a consequence may arrive when breaking blocks. One of the 5 new monsters related to their ores will spawn if you break them so bring some gear with you if you plan to harvest these artificial ores."
